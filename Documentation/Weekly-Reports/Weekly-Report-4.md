# Weekly Report 4

**Time spent:** ~ 10 hours 

## What did I do this week?
This week I focused on restructuring the project into a cleaner and more maintainable format. I separated the code into a proper src/ module with trie.py, namegen.py, and __init__.py, which makes the logic easier to navigate. In addition to this, I tweaked my code so that frequencies and successors are counted in one iteration, instead of two. I also worked on the Gradio application, adding support for multiple datasets such as female.txt, male.txt, the Finnish datasets, and a combined option. I also added dataset descriptions to help users understand the source and purpose of each option. Finally, I revised and fixed the test cases in test_trie.py so they align with the new code structure.

## How has the program progressed?
The program has progressed from being a prototype in a single file to becoming a modular and more polished application. The Gradio interface is now stable and user-friendly, and it integrates dataset selection directly. At this stage, the program feels closer to a usable tool rather than just an experiment.

## What did I learn this week/today?
This week I realized that combining the counting of frequencies and successors into one pass both simplified the code and improved performance. I also gained more experience in designing a user interface with Gradio that not only exposes parameters but also guides users with dataset descriptions and clear feedback about what is being used.

## What remains unclear or has been challenging?
Some challenges remain with fine-tuning the generation quality. The outputs can sometimes be too short or fail to generate when the n-gram order is set too high. Testing random name generation also remains a challenge, since outputs are not deterministic and cannot always be checked directly.

 
## What will I do next?
Next, I plan to continue refining the Gradio app by adding a minimum length option and improving the formatting of outputs. I also want to expand the dataset options further, possibly by including more public name lists or more diverse datasets. For the testing side, I will explore strategies for validating stochastic generation by checking statistical properties instead of specific outputs. There are also some error cases I need to handle in the user inputs (for example, when exact_length > max_length).
